Summarized:
1. Need to install NPM (node package manager)
2. Create a new directory for the project
3. In a console run "npm init" within the directory. 
4. It'll do some stuff and you'll end up with this:
	your-app/
	├── package.json
	├── main.js
	└── index.html
5. Change package.js to include this code instead of the default code. 
   This code runs an electron project instead of a node project:
	{
  	"name": "your-app",
  	"version": "0.1.0",
  	"main": "main.js",
  	"scripts": {
    	"start": "electron ."
  		}
	}
6. Now install electron, run in a console: "npm install --save-dev electron"
7. To start the project just run: "npm start" into the console when in the 
   directory of your project. 

Essentially electron loads a webpage inside a stripped down version of google chrome. 
The GUI is entirely dependent on css/js. The attached project is a very basic test I did
so that I could figure out how this works. The main.js is what actually constructs the 
window and loads the starting webpage.
