Dev Bug 1 (1/28/2019, RC):
	'electron' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
	operable program or batch file....

Fix: this indicates electron isnt installed locally, as long as you have node and npm installed, the fix is easy. 
Simply run npm i -g electron, rebuild the app with 'npm build' and try to start it again with 'npm start'
